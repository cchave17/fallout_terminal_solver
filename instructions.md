ffalkjffWrite a Python program that assists in solving the hacking terminal minigame from Fallout 4. The program should:  
- Prompt the user to enter the initial list of possible passwords as a comma-separated string (e.g., 'APPLE,MAPLE,AMPLE,TABLE'), where all words are uppercase and have the same length.  
- Implement a function to calculate the 'likeness' between two words, defined as the number of positions where the letters are identical.  
- Repeatedly:  
  - Display the current list of possible passwords.  
  - Ask the user to input the word they guessed (from the current list) and the likeness score received from the game.  
  - Update the list by keeping only the words that have exactly the same likeness to the guessed word as the likeness score provided, effectively removing all words that could not be the solution based on this information.  
  - If the list is reduced to a single word, display it as the solution and terminate the program.  
  - If the list becomes empty, inform the user that no possible solution exists (likely due to inconsistent input) and terminate.  
- Continue this process until the solution is found or no words remain.  
- Ensure the program includes all necessary functions, such as one to compute likeness and any others needed for input handling or list updating.  
- Make the program user-friendly with clear instructions and robust input handling (e.g., converting inputs to uppercase, validating the guessed word is in the list).  
Additionally, suggest an appropriate filename for the script, such as 'fallout_hacking_solver.py'.
